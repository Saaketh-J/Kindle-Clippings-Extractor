# Kindle-Clippings-Extractor

This is a simple tool to extract your Kindle highlights by passing in the MyClippings.txt file from the Kindle. 

I've only seen a few ways to do this like Readwise or a Chrome extension. Readwise has a monthly subscription and the extension requires a Notion account and creates a page with the clippings within that. I wasn't able to find a simple way to just get my highlights sorted by book so I created this tool.

Steps to use:
1. Run this Streamlit app OR go to <https://kindle-clippings-extractor.streamlit.app/>
2. Connect your Kindle to computer via USB
3. Find the "My Clippings.txt" file within the documents folder
4. Drag the file into the area in the left side panel
5. Optional: Select displaying page/location info
6. Viola, your clippings from each book will be displayed in the center area

Here's an example of what the UI looks like:
